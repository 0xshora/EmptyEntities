# EmptyEntities
This project is for the Memetic AW Hackathon. : https://awhack.xyz/hackathon/1

# Concept
This is a meme project representing the notion that "AW should be able to be constructed from two empty entities."

The essence of AW (Autonomous World) lies in autonomy and composability.

If so, it should be possible to establish an AW starting from an entity of nothingness.

However, currently, there is no universally acknowledged AW.

Why can't this become an AW?

What would be the minimal constituent elements of an AW?

Starting with two entities(Player and Land), when a universally acknowledged AW is completed, wouldn't it be the time for humanity to have created an AW?

What is lacking in this project?
- Gamification
- Incentive Mechanism
- Permissionless Composability
- Frontend
- etc.

This project itself serves as a meme representing the current state of AW and the ultimate destination.
